# Node application

This is the node application. I should add more docs but...

## Quickstart

You need to run:
```
npm install --production
```

And then:
```
npm start
```

## Options

There are a number of parameters to configure the app via env vars:

- `PORT`: Specifies on which port will the app be listening.
